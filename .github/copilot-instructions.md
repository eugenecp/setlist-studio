# Copilot Instructions for Setlist Studio

## Quick Reference

### Essential Rules
- **Test Naming**: `{SourceClass}Tests.cs` (base) or `{SourceClass}AdvancedTests.cs` (advanced only)
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+ line and branch coverage
- **Security Analysis**: All code must pass CodeQL security scans with zero high/critical issues
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (Core/Infrastructure/Web)
- **Framework**: .NET 8 + Blazor Server + MudBlazor + xUnit

### CRITICAL: Test File Creation Workflow
1. **Check existing**: Use `file_search` for `{SourceClass}Tests.cs`
2. **Enhance first**: Add to base test file before creating new ones
3. **Strict naming**: Only `Tests.cs` or `AdvancedTests.cs` suffixes
4. **No custom names**: Never use "FocusedTests", "CoverageTests", etc.

### Customer Delight Assessment Framework

**When reviewing this project, always evaluate from a customer and stakeholder perspective — not as a developer.**

Assess the project for customer delight by focusing on the experience and value it provides to end users, not the technical implementation.

#### Customer Delight Evaluation Criteria

**User Problem & Value Proposition:**
- Does the product clearly solve a real user or business problem?
- Is the solution aligned with actual musician workflows and performance needs?
- Does it address genuine pain points in setlist management and music organization?

**User Experience Quality:**
- Is it intuitive, easy to use, and visually pleasing?
- Are there moments of delight — small touches that make it feel polished or special?
- Does it feel reliable, responsive, and professional?
- Would end users feel confident and satisfied using it daily?

**Communication & Clarity:**
- Does it communicate its purpose and value clearly to non-technical users?
- Are features discoverable and self-explanatory to musicians?
- Is the interface terminology familiar to music industry professionals?

**Friction Analysis:**
- Are there any friction points, confusing steps, or unmet expectations?
- Does the workflow match how musicians naturally organize and perform music?
- Are there barriers to adoption or daily usage?

#### Assessment Deliverables

When evaluating customer delight, always provide:

1. **User Experience Summary**: A concise overview of the overall user experience quality
2. **Delight Strengths**: Specific features, interactions, or design elements that contribute to customer satisfaction
3. **Improvement Opportunities**: Concrete areas where user satisfaction could be enhanced
4. **Customer Delight Rating**: A 1-10 rating of how much delight this product likely brings to its users
5. **Usage Confidence**: Assessment of whether users would feel confident using this product in professional settings

#### Focus Areas for Customer Assessment

**Performance Context**: Always consider real-world usage scenarios:

## Testing Framework

### Coverage Standards

Setlist Studio maintains **100% test success rate requirement** with minimum 80% code coverage for both line and branch coverage at file and project levels.

**PRIORITY: Individual File Coverage First**
- **Target each file to 80%+ line AND branch coverage before moving to the next file**
- **Focus on files closest to 80% threshold first** (e.g., 75%+ files get priority)
- **Complete one file at a time** rather than spreading effort across multiple files
- **Use file-specific coverage analysis** to identify exact uncovered lines and branches
- **Create targeted tests** for specific line coverage gaps and branch conditions
- **Verify both line and branch coverage targets are met before proceeding**

**Quality Metrics Requirements:**
- **Test Success Rate**: **100% of all tests must pass** - zero tolerance for failing tests
- **Build Quality**: **Zero build warnings** in main and test projects - clean builds required
- **Security Analysis**: **Zero high/critical CodeQL security issues** - all security vulnerabilities must be resolved
- **Individual File Coverage**: **Each file must achieve at least 80% line AND branch coverage before moving to next file**
- **Line Coverage**: Each file must achieve at least 80% line coverage
- **Branch Coverage**: Each file must achieve at least 80% branch coverage
- **Project Coverage**: Overall project must maintain at least 80% line and branch coverage
- **CRAP Score**: All methods must maintain passing CRAP scores
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: All methods must maintain passing complexity metrics
- **Test Reliability**: All tests must be deterministic and pass consistently

### Test Framework Requirements

- **xUnit**: Primary testing framework for all unit and integration tests
- **Moq**: For creating mocks and stubs of dependencies
- **FluentAssertions**: For readable, expressive test assertions
- **Bunit**: For Blazor component testing

### Test File Organization

Setlist Studio follows a strategic test organization approach that separates core functionality tests from specialized coverage and edge case tests.

#### MANDATORY TEST FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

**STRICT ENFORCEMENT REQUIRED - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

1. **ALWAYS check if base test file exists FIRST**
2. **NEVER create custom-named test files** (e.g., "FocusedTests", "CoverageTests", "SpecializedTests")  
3. **FOLLOW EXACT naming pattern** - one source class = one test class

#### Test File Structure

- **Base Test Files** (e.g., `SetlistServiceTests.cs`): Core functionality and primary business logic scenarios
- **Advanced Test Files** (e.g., `SetlistServiceAdvancedTests.cs`): Edge cases, error conditions, validation boundaries
- **Specialized Test Files** (e.g., `ProgramAdvancedTests.cs`): Environment-specific configurations, startup logic

#### Naming Conventions

**REQUIRED NAMING PATTERN - NEVER DEVIATE:**
- **Source File**: `{ClassName}.cs` → **Test File**: `{ClassName}Tests.cs`
- **Advanced Tests**: `{SourceClass}AdvancedTests.cs`
- **Razor Component**: `{ComponentName}.razor` → **Test File**: `{ComponentName}Tests.cs`

**CORRECT Examples:**
- `MainLayout.razor` → `MainLayoutTests.cs`
- `SetlistService.cs` → `SetlistServiceTests.cs`
- `Program.cs` → `ProgramTests.cs`

**PROHIBITED Examples:**
- `MainLayoutFocusedTests.cs` ← WRONG
- `MainLayoutCoverageTests.cs` ← WRONG
- `SetlistServiceUnitTests.cs` ← WRONG
- `ProgramConfigurationTests.cs` ← WRONG

#### Test File Creation Workflow - MANDATORY STEPS

**STEP 1: Always Check Base Test File First**
```bash
# Use file_search tool in VS Code or:
# Linux/Mac: find . -name "{ClassName}Tests.cs"  
# Windows: Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Name "*{ClassName}Tests.cs"
# VS Code: Use file_search tool with "{ClassName}Tests.cs"
```

**STEP 2: Determine Appropriate Action**
- **If base test exists**: Enhance existing `{ClassName}Tests.cs` with core functionality tests
- **If base test missing**: Create `{ClassName}Tests.cs` for core functionality FIRST
- **If base test >1,400 lines**: ONLY THEN create `{ClassName}AdvancedTests.cs`

#### When to Create Advanced Test Files

**STRICT CRITERIA - ALL MUST BE MET:**
- **File Size**: Base test files exceed ~1,400 lines
- **Different Purposes**: Tests target specific coverage gaps rather than core business logic
- **Specialized Testing**: Error handling, validation boundaries, configuration scenarios
- **Coverage Targeting**: Tests specifically to reach 80%+ line and branch coverage
- **Base Tests Complete**: Core functionality is fully tested in base test file

#### Advanced Test Content Guidelines

- **Validation Boundaries**: Test min/max values, field length limits, required field validation
- **Edge Cases**: Null inputs, empty strings, special characters, Unicode handling
- **Error Conditions**: Database failures, network issues, invalid configurations
- **Authentication Scenarios**: Missing credentials, invalid tokens, authorization failures
- **Configuration Testing**: Environment-specific settings, database provider selection
- **Performance Edge Cases**: Large datasets, concurrent operations, resource limits
- **Edge Cases**: Null inputs, empty strings, special characters, Unicode handling
- **Error Conditions**: Database failures, network issues, invalid configurations
- **Authentication Scenarios**: Missing credentials, invalid tokens, authorization failures
- **Configuration Testing**: Environment-specific settings, database provider selection
- **Performance Edge Cases**: Large datasets, concurrent operations, resource limits

### Test Organization Best Practices

**ENFORCEMENT RULES:**
- **Naming Compliance**: NO custom test file names allowed - follow exact patterns only
- **File Size Limits**: Base test files under 1,500 lines; create advanced tests when exceeded
- **Single Responsibility**: Each test file focuses on ONE source class only
- **Check Before Create**: Always verify base test file exists before creating any test
- **Maintainability**: Keep individual test files under 1,500 lines for easy navigation
- **Clear Separation**: Base tests cover happy paths; advanced tests cover edge cases
- **Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive test method names: `MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedResult`
- **Documentation**: Include comprehensive XML documentation for advanced test files

### Test File Validation Checklist

**Before creating ANY test file, verify:**
- [ ] Checked if `{SourceClass}Tests.cs` exists using `file_search` tool
- [ ] Using exact naming pattern: `{SourceClass}Tests.cs` or `{SourceClass}AdvancedTests.cs`
- [ ] NOT using custom names like "FocusedTests", "CoverageTests", "SpecializedTests"
- [ ] Base test file exists and is >1,400 lines (if creating advanced tests)
- [ ] Tests target single source class/component only
- [ ] Following test organization hierarchy (base → advanced)

**VALIDATION EXAMPLE:**
```bash
# 1. Check existing: file_search for "MainLayoutTests.cs"
# 2. If found: Enhance MainLayoutTests.cs with new tests
# 3. If not found: Create MainLayoutTests.cs (not MainLayoutFocusedTests.cs)
# 4. Advanced tests: Only if MainLayoutTests.cs >1,400 lines → MainLayoutAdvancedTests.cs
```

## Coverage Standards

### Running Coverage Analysis

```bash
# Run tests with coverage collection
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory:./TestResults/[TestRun]

# Generate HTML coverage report
reportgenerator -reports:"./TestResults/[TestRun]/*/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"./CoverageReport/[TestRun]" -reporttypes:Html

# Open coverage report in browser
# Navigate to ./CoverageReport/[TestRun]/index.html
```

### Coverage Analysis Commands

```bash
# Quick coverage check for current changes
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory:./TestResults/QuickCheck

# Full coverage analysis with detailed reporting
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory:./TestResults/FullAnalysis
reportgenerator -reports:"./TestResults/FullAnalysis/*/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"./CoverageReport/FullAnalysis" -reporttypes:Html

# Coverage comparison between branches
reportgenerator -reports:"./TestResults/*/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"./CoverageReport/Comparison" -reporttypes:Html -historydirectory:"./CoverageReport/History"
```

### Coverage Improvement Methodology

1. **Identify Gaps**: Use coverage reports to find files below 80% line/branch coverage
2. **Analyze Uncovered Code**: Determine if gaps are in core logic (add to base tests) or edge cases (create advanced tests)
3. **Strategic Testing**: Create targeted advanced tests for authentication, validation, error handling
4. **Validate Impact**: Run coverage analysis after adding advanced tests to measure improvement
5. **Maintain Quality**: Ensure all new tests follow naming conventions and documentation standards

### Coverage Report Structure

- **CoverageReport/**: Root directory for all coverage analysis reports
  - **[TestRun]/**: Timestamped or named subdirectories for different test runs
    - **index.html**: Main coverage report with summary and detailed breakdowns
    - **[Assembly]_[Class].html**: Detailed line-by-line coverage for specific classes

### Quality Metrics Analysis

- **CRAP Score**: Change Risk Anti-Patterns score combining complexity and coverage
  - Target: Keep CRAP score low by maintaining high test coverage on complex methods
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures code complexity through decision points
  - Target: Break down methods with high complexity or ensure comprehensive testing

### CodeQL Static Security Analysis

**CodeQL is MANDATORY for all code contributions** - it performs static application security testing (SAST) to identify vulnerabilities before they reach production.

#### CodeQL Analysis Configurations

Setlist Studio uses **two different CodeQL analysis configurations** aligned with GitHub Actions security.yaml:

**1. Security-Focused Analysis (Local Development)**
- **Query Suite**: `codeql/csharp-security-extended.qls` (68 security queries)
- **Purpose**: Critical security vulnerability detection
- **Target**: **Zero high/critical security issues** (blocking)
- **Use**: Pre-commit validation, security-focused development

**2. Comprehensive Quality Analysis (GitHub Actions)**
- **Query Suite**: `security-and-quality` (170 comprehensive queries)  
- **Purpose**: Security + code quality + best practices
- **Configuration**: `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`
- **Results**: Security issues + warnings + recommendations
- **Use**: CI/CD pipeline, comprehensive code review

#### Running CodeQL Analysis Locally

**OPTION 1: Use Provided Scripts (Recommended)**

**Security-Focused Analysis:**
```powershell
# Quick security validation (68 security queries)
.\scripts\run-codeql-security.ps1

# With clean database rebuild
.\scripts\run-codeql-security.ps1 -CleanDatabase
```

**Comprehensive Analysis (Matches GitHub Actions Exactly):**
```powershell
# Full analysis matching GitHub Actions security.yml
.\scripts\run-codeql-comprehensive.ps1

# With clean database and open results
.\scripts\run-codeql-comprehensive.ps1 -CleanDatabase -OpenResults
```

**OPTION 2: Manual Commands (Advanced)**

**Security-Only Analysis:**
```powershell
# Create CodeQL database (matches GitHub Actions build)
codeql database create codeql-database --language=csharp --command="dotnet build SetlistStudio.sln --configuration Release --no-restore" --source-root=.

# Run security-focused analysis
codeql database analyze codeql-database --format=sarif-latest --output=security-analysis.sarif codeql/csharp-security-extended.qls --download

# Check results (should be zero for security compliance)
$results = (Get-Content security-analysis.sarif | ConvertFrom-Json).runs[0].results
Write-Host "Security issues found: $($results.Count)"
```

**Comprehensive Analysis (GitHub Actions Match):**
```powershell
# Run full analysis with local config (mirrors GitHub Actions)
codeql database analyze codeql-database --format=sarif-latest --output=github-analysis.sarif --config-file=.codeql/codeql-config.yml codeql/csharp-queries:codeql-suites/csharp-security-and-quality.qls --download

# Categorize findings by severity (matches GitHub Actions analysis)
$sarif = Get-Content github-analysis.sarif | ConvertFrom-Json; $results = $sarif.runs[0].results; $rules = $sarif.runs[0].tool.driver.rules; $findings = @{}; foreach($result in $results) { $rule = $rules | Where-Object { $_.id -eq $result.ruleId }; $severity = $rule.properties.'problem.severity'; if($findings.ContainsKey($severity)) { $findings[$severity]++ } else { $findings[$severity] = 1 } }; $findings.GetEnumerator() | Sort-Object Value -Descending
```

#### Local CodeQL Configuration

**Configuration Files:**
- **`.codeql/codeql-config.yml`**: Local configuration mirroring GitHub Actions exactly
- **`.codeql/config.env`**: Environment variables for local development
- **`scripts/run-codeql-local.ps1`**: Main analysis script with full configurability
- **`scripts/run-codeql-security.ps1`**: Quick security-focused analysis
- **`scripts/run-codeql-comprehensive.ps1`**: Full analysis matching GitHub Actions

**Local vs GitHub Actions Alignment:**
- **Same Query Suites**: Both use `security-and-quality` for comprehensive analysis
- **Same Build Commands**: Both use `dotnet build SetlistStudio.sln --configuration Release --no-restore`
- **Same Path Exclusions**: Tests, build artifacts, coverage reports excluded
- **Same Output Format**: SARIF with structured findings categorization
- **Same Configuration File**: `.codeql/codeql-config.yml` mirrors `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`

#### CodeQL Automated Analysis

CodeQL analysis runs automatically via GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/security.yml):
- **All pull requests** to main branch
- **Push to main branch** (for baseline maintenance)  
- **Daily scheduled scans** (2 AM UTC)
- **Manual workflow dispatch** (ad-hoc security audits)

#### CodeQL Security Standards

**ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY FOR SECURITY ISSUES:**
- **Critical security issues**: Must be fixed before merge - **no exceptions**
- **High security issues**: Must be fixed before merge - **no exceptions**
- **Medium security issues**: Should be fixed or justified with suppression

**CODE QUALITY FINDINGS (Non-blocking):**
- **Warnings**: Code quality issues, potential bugs (162 typical findings)
- **Recommendations**: Best practice suggestions (68 typical findings)
- **Notes**: Minor improvements and optimizations

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION**: 
- **Security findings** = Blocking (must fix)
- **Quality findings** = Non-blocking (continuous improvement)

#### CodeQL Results Interpretation

**Understanding GitHub Actions Results:**

When GitHub Actions reports "67 new alerts" (22 warnings + 45 notes), this includes:
- **Security vulnerabilities** (if any) - **BLOCKING**
- **Code quality warnings** - Non-blocking  
- **Best practice recommendations** - Non-blocking

**Local vs GitHub Analysis Comparison:**
- **Local Security Analysis**: `0 results` = No security vulnerabilities ✅
- **GitHub Comprehensive Analysis**: `230 results` = Security + quality findings
- **Discrepancy is Expected**: Different query scopes, not a security concern

**ALWAYS CHECK GitHub Security Tab** for actual security findings rather than relying on workflow summaries.

#### CodeQL Issue Resolution

**For Security Issues (Critical/High):**
1. **Immediate action**: Treat as security failure regardless of other scan results
2. **Root cause analysis**: Understand the vulnerability and potential impact  
3. **Secure implementation**: Fix underlying security flaw, don't just suppress
4. **Validation testing**: Ensure fix resolves issue without breaking functionality
5. **Re-verification**: Run security-focused CodeQL to confirm resolution
6. **Documentation**: Explain security improvements in commit messages

**For Quality Issues (Warnings/Recommendations):**
1. **Assess impact**: Determine if issue affects maintainability or performance
2. **Prioritize fix**: Address based on code quality improvement value
3. **Batch improvements**: Group similar quality fixes in dedicated PRs
4. **Document rationale**: Explain quality improvements in commit messages

#### CodeQL Configuration Files

**Local Security Configuration:**
- Uses default security-extended query suite
- Focuses on OWASP Top 10 and CWE security categories
- Excludes test files and build artifacts

**GitHub Actions Configuration (.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml):**
```yaml
queries:
  - uses: security-and-quality
paths-ignore:
  - "tests/**"
  - "**/bin/**"
  - "**/obj/**"  
  - "TestResults/**"
  - "CoverageReport/**"
paths:
  - "src/**"
  - "*.cs"
  - "*.cshtml"
  - "*.razor"
```

#### CodeQL Best Practices

**To minimize security findings:**
- **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Parameterized queries**: Never concatenate user input into SQL strings
- **Secure defaults**: Use secure configurations and libraries
- **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Access control**: Implement proper authorization checks
- **Secrets management**: Never hardcode credentials or API keys

**To minimize quality findings:**
- **Resource disposal**: Use `using` statements for IDisposable objects
- **Performance optimization**: Avoid string concatenation in loops
- **API modernization**: Replace obsolete method calls
- **Documentation**: Add XML documentation for public APIs
- **Code simplification**: Reduce complexity and nested conditions

#### CodeQL Suppression Guidelines

**Security Issue Suppressions (Rare):**
- Only suppress **confirmed false positives** after thorough security review
- Require security team approval for high/critical suppression
- Document detailed justification with security impact analysis
- Regular review of all security suppressions

**Quality Issue Suppressions (Selective):**
- Suppress when fixing would reduce code readability or maintainability
- Document business justification for suppression
- Consider suppression for generated code or third-party integrations
- Review suppressions during major refactoring efforts

#### Common CodeQL Issues in .NET Applications

**Security Issues (Must Fix):**
- **SQL Injection**: Use Entity Framework LINQ queries instead of raw SQL
- **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Always encode output, validate inputs
- **Path Traversal**: Validate file paths, use safe file operations
- **Information Disclosure**: Sanitize error messages and logs
- **Authentication Bypass**: Implement proper authorization checks
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Use strong algorithms and proper key management

**Quality Issues (Continuous Improvement):**
- **Resource Management**: Dispose IDisposable objects properly
- **Performance**: Optimize string operations and LINQ usage
- **API Usage**: Update obsolete method calls and improve error handling
- **Code Structure**: Simplify complex conditions and reduce nesting
- **Documentation**: Add XML comments for public APIs

### BPM Ranges
- **Ballads**: 60-80 BPM
- **Medium Tempo**: 90-120 BPM  
- **Up-tempo**: 130-160 BPM
- **Fast Songs**: 170+ BPM

### Common Keys
- **Guitar-friendly**: E, A, D, G, C
- **Vocal-friendly**: F, Bb, Eb, Ab
- **Minor keys**: Am, Em, Bm, F#m, Cm

## CodeQL Code Generation Standards

**MANDATORY: All generated code must pass CodeQL static analysis with zero high/critical security issues.**

### Code Generation Requirements

When generating any code (classes, methods, controllers, services, tests), **ALWAYS** ensure:

#### 1. **Security-First Code Generation**
- **Input Validation**: Every user input must be validated and sanitized
- **Parameterized Queries**: Never concatenate user input into SQL strings - use Entity Framework LINQ exclusively
- **Authorization Checks**: Every data access operation must verify user ownership
- **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages or logs
- **Resource Management**: Always use `using` statements for IDisposable objects

#### 2. **Null Safety and Type Safety**
- **Explicit Null Handling**: Use null-conditional operators (`?.`) and null-forgiving operators (`!`) appropriately
- **Avoid `default()` Casts**: Use explicit nullable casts like `(HttpContext?)null` instead of `default(HttpContext)`
- **Null Checks**: Add proper null checks before accessing potentially null variables
- **Non-nullable References**: Leverage C# nullable reference types to prevent null reference exceptions

#### 3. **LINQ and Performance Best Practices**
- **Use LINQ Methods**: Replace foreach loops with appropriate LINQ methods (`.Select()`, `.Where()`, `.Any()`)
- **Avoid Unnecessary Variables**: Don't create variables that are assigned but never used
- **Efficient Queries**: Use `FirstOrDefaultAsync()` instead of `Where().FirstAsync()` when appropriate
- **Resource Optimization**: Avoid string concatenation in loops, use `StringBuilder` or string interpolation

#### 4. **Authentication and Authorization Patterns**
```csharp
// CORRECT: Always validate user ownership
var userId = User.Identity?.Name ?? throw new UnauthorizedAccessException();
var userResource = await _service.GetByUserIdAsync(userId, resourceId);
if (userResource == null) throw new ForbiddenException();

// INCORRECT: Direct access without validation
var resource = await _service.GetByIdAsync(resourceId); // Missing ownership check
```

#### 5. **Input Validation Patterns**
```csharp
// CORRECT: Comprehensive validation
[SafeBpm(40, 250)]
public int Bpm { get; set; }

if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(userInput) || userInput.Length > 500)
    throw new ValidationException("Invalid input");

var sanitized = SecureLoggingHelper.SanitizeMessage(userInput);

// INCORRECT: No validation
public int Bpm { get; set; } // Missing validation attribute
var query = $"SELECT * FROM Songs WHERE Name = '{userInput}'"; // SQL injection risk
```

#### 6. **Error Handling Patterns**
```csharp
// CORRECT: Secure error handling
try 
{
    // Operation
}
catch (UnauthorizedAccessException)
{
    _logger.LogWarning("Unauthorized access attempt by user {UserId}", userId);
    return Forbid();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    _logger.LogError(ex, "Operation failed for user {UserId}", userId);
    return Problem("An error occurred processing your request");
}

// INCORRECT: Information leakage
catch (Exception ex)
{
    return BadRequest(ex.Message); // Exposes internal details
}
```

#### 7. **Resource Management Patterns**
```csharp
// CORRECT: Proper disposal
using var scope = _serviceProvider.CreateScope();
await using var stream = File.OpenRead(path);

// CORRECT: Explicit disposal in tests
_mockHttpContextAccessor.Setup(x => x.HttpContext).Returns((HttpContext?)null);

// INCORRECT: Resource leaks
var stream = File.OpenRead(path); // Missing using statement
```

### CodeQL Quality Standards

#### **Common CodeQL Issues to Avoid:**

1. **Dereferenced variable may be null**
   - Use null-conditional operators: `user?.Name`
   - Add null-forgiving operators after null checks: `result!.Message`
   - Validate parameters: `name ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(name))`

2. **Useless assignment to local variable**
   - Remove unused variables
   - Use discard pattern `_` only when appropriate
   - Assign and use variables in the same scope

3. **Useless upcast**
   - Use explicit nullable casts: `(Type?)null` instead of `default(Type)`
   - Let compiler handle implicit conversions

4. **Missed opportunity to use LINQ**
   - Replace `foreach` + `Add()` with `.Select()`
   - Replace `foreach` + `if` with `.Where()`
   - Use `Any()` instead of `Count() > 0`

### Pre-Generation Checklist

**Before generating any code, ensure:**
- [ ] Input validation is implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Authorization checks verify user ownership of resources
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Resource disposal is handled with `using` statements
- [ ] Null safety is addressed with appropriate operators
- [ ] LINQ methods are used instead of manual loops where appropriate
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or connection strings
- [ ] Logging doesn't expose sensitive data

### CodeQL Validation Commands

**Always validate generated code with:**
```bash
# Security-focused analysis (zero issues required)
codeql database analyze codeql-database --output=security-analysis.sarif codeql/csharp-security-extended.qls

# Quality analysis for comprehensive review
codeql database analyze codeql-database --output=quality-analysis.sarif codeql/csharp-queries:codeql-suites/csharp-security-and-quality.qls
```

## Copilot Prompts

### Testing & Quality Assurance

**ALWAYS follow these naming conventions - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

```
"Check if SetlistServiceTests.cs exists, then enhance it with comprehensive unit tests for the setlist creation endpoint"

"First verify SongServiceTests.cs exists, then create SongServiceAdvancedTests.cs ONLY IF base file exceeds 1,400 lines"

"Check if ProgramTests.cs exists first, then create ProgramAdvancedTests.cs for authentication configuration scenarios"

"Enhance existing SetlistServiceTests.cs with position adjustment tests, create SetlistServiceAdvancedTests.cs only if needed"

"First check if MainLayoutTests.cs exists, then enhance it with core functionality tests before considering advanced tests"

"Verify LoginTests.cs exists, then add authentication edge cases to the base file or create LoginAdvancedTests.cs if base file is too large"

"Always follow {SourceClass}Tests.cs naming pattern - NEVER create custom-named test files like 'FocusedTests' or 'CoverageTests'"

"Before creating any test file, use file_search to check if base test file exists, then enhance existing file or create properly named new file"

"Write validation boundary tests covering minimum/maximum values, field length limits, and required field validation"

"Generate authentication scenario tests for missing credentials, invalid tokens, and authorization failures"

"Create performance edge case tests for large datasets, concurrent operations, and resource exhaustion scenarios"

"Analyze current code coverage and identify classes/methods missing tests to reach 80% line and branch coverage"

"Generate coverage report in CoverageReport/NewFeature and analyze which classes need additional testing"
```

### Architecture & Scalability

```
"Optimize the query for fetching large setlists with song metadata using Entity Framework"

"Implement pagination for the artists endpoint to handle thousands of artists efficiently"

"Add caching layer for frequently accessed song and artist data"

"Redesign the setlist storage to support better performance with 10,000+ songs per user"

"Add database indexes for user-specific queries on Songs and Setlists tables to improve query performance"

"Implement distributed caching with Redis to support horizontal scaling across multiple server instances"

"Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better concurrent user support and write performance"

"Add connection pooling to handle 100+ concurrent database connections efficiently"

"Implement response caching for expensive operations like genre listings and artist aggregations"

"Design API endpoints to support bulk operations for better performance with large datasets"

"Add database query optimization with proper LINQ usage to minimize N+1 query problems"

"Implement background jobs for heavy operations like setlist calculations and data aggregations"

"Configure load balancing with sticky sessions to support Blazor Server horizontal scaling"

"Add performance monitoring and metrics collection for database query times and memory usage"
```

### Data Querying & Filtering Patterns

```
"Implement genre filtering with exact matching for structured fields - use database indexes efficiently"

"Apply query composition pattern: start with base query, conditionally add filters, then execute once"

"Use exact match (==) for structured fields (Genre, MusicalKey, DifficultyRating) to leverage database indexes"

"Use partial match (Contains) for free-text fields (Title, Artist, Album) where flexibility is needed"

"Implement controller-level input normalization for case handling without breaking index usage"

"Return pagination tuple (IEnumerable<T> data, int totalCount) with Count() before Skip/Take"

"Order results consistently (OrderBy Artist, ThenBy Title) before applying pagination"

"Filter by user ownership FIRST: query = _context.Songs.Where(s => s.UserId == userId)"

"Build query incrementally: if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(filter)) query = query.Where(...)"

"Execute query once: var totalCount = await query.CountAsync(); var results = await query.OrderBy(...).Skip(...).Take(...).ToListAsync()"

"Avoid case-insensitive queries in service layer (ToLower() breaks index usage) - normalize at controller level instead"

"Cache expensive aggregations (GetGenresAsync, GetArtistsAsync) using cache-aside pattern with per-user scope"

"Target <100ms for all database queries, <20ms for indexed exact-match filters"

"Use composite indexes for common filter patterns: (UserId, Genre), (UserId, Artist), (UserId, Title)"

"Implement pagination validation: page >= 1, pageSize between 1-100"

"Design filtering endpoints for musician workflows: genre dropdowns populated from distinct query results"

"Test filtering with realistic musical data: various genres (Rock, Jazz, Hip-Hop), special characters (R&B, K-Pop)"

"Validate filter inputs for security: check for SQL injection, XSS, and malicious content before querying"

"Create dropdown-friendly APIs: GetGenresAsync() returns distinct values for UI selection, filtering uses exact matches"

"Document filtering pattern: Structured fields → Exact match (fast), Free-text fields → Partial match (flexible)"
```

## Genre Filtering Pattern: Complete Implementation Guide

### Pattern Overview

**Genre filtering with pagination** is a fundamental feature for musicians to organize and access their song libraries efficiently. This pattern demonstrates how to implement high-performance, secure filtering that scales to thousands of songs while maintaining excellent user experience.

---

### ✅ **How It Works**

#### **Core Implementation Pattern**

```csharp
// SERVICE LAYER: SongService.cs
public async Task<(IEnumerable<Song> Songs, int TotalCount)> GetSongsAsync(
    string userId,
    string? searchTerm = null,
    string? genre = null,
    string? tags = null,
    int pageNumber = 1,
    int pageSize = 20)
{
    // 1. Start with user-scoped query
    var query = _context.Songs.Where(s => s.UserId == userId);

    // 2. Apply search filter (partial match for free-text)
    if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(searchTerm))
    {
        var lowerSearch = searchTerm.ToLower();
        query = query.Where(s => 
            s.Title.ToLower().Contains(lowerSearch) ||
            s.Artist.ToLower().Contains(lowerSearch) ||
            (s.Album != null && s.Album.ToLower().Contains(lowerSearch)));
    }

    // 3. Apply genre filter (exact match for structured data)
    if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(genre))
    {
        query = query.Where(s => s.Genre == genre);  // ✅ Uses index
    }

    // 4. Apply tags filter
    if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(tags))
    {
        query = query.Where(s => s.Tags != null && s.Tags.Contains(tags));
    }

    // 5. Count total before pagination
    var totalCount = await query.CountAsync();

    // 6. Apply consistent ordering and pagination
    var songs = await query
        .OrderBy(s => s.Artist)
        .ThenBy(s => s.Title)
        .Skip((pageNumber - 1) * pageSize)
        .Take(pageSize)
        .ToListAsync();

    return (songs, totalCount);
}
```

```csharp
// CONTROLLER LAYER: SongsController.cs
[HttpGet("genre/{genre}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetSongsByGenre(
    [FromRoute] string genre,
    [FromQuery] int page = 1,
    [FromQuery] int pageSize = 20)
{
    // 1. Input validation
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(genre))
        return BadRequest(new { error = "Genre parameter is required" });

    // 2. Pagination validation
    if (page < 1)
        return BadRequest(new { error = "Page number must be greater than 0" });
    
    if (pageSize < 1 || pageSize > 100)
        return BadRequest(new { error = "Page size must be between 1 and 100" });

    // 3. Security validation
    if (ContainsMaliciousContent(genre))
        return BadRequest(new { error = "Invalid genre parameter" });

    // 4. Optional: Controller-level normalization
    var normalizedGenre = genre.Trim();  // Preserves index usage

    // 5. Call service with filters
    var (songs, totalCount) = await _songService.GetSongsAsync(
        userId: SecureUserContext.GetSanitizedUserId(User),
        genre: normalizedGenre,
        pageNumber: page,
        pageSize: pageSize);

    // 6. Calculate pagination metadata
    var totalPages = (int)Math.Ceiling(totalCount / (double)pageSize);

    // 7. Return structured response
    return Ok(new
    {
        songs,
        pagination = new
        {
            currentPage = page,
            pageSize,
            totalCount,
            totalPages,
            hasNextPage = page < totalPages,
            hasPreviousPage = page > 1
        },
        filter = new
        {
            genre = normalizedGenre
        }
    });
}
```

#### **Query Execution Flow**

1. **User Isolation** → Filter by `UserId` first (security + index)
2. **Conditional Filters** → Build query incrementally based on provided parameters
3. **Count Total** → Execute `CountAsync()` for pagination metadata
4. **Order Consistently** → Always `OrderBy(Artist).ThenBy(Title)` for predictable results
5. **Apply Pagination** → `Skip((page - 1) * pageSize).Take(pageSize)`
6. **Single Execution** → All filters applied in one database round-trip

---

### 🔒 **Security Requirements**

#### **1. Input Validation**

```csharp
// Validate genre parameter
if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(genre))
    return BadRequest(new { error = "Genre parameter is required" });

// Validate pagination bounds
if (page < 1 || pageSize < 1 || pageSize > 100)
    return BadRequest(new { error = "Invalid pagination parameters" });
```

#### **2. Malicious Content Detection**

```csharp
private bool ContainsMaliciousContent(string input)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(input)) return false;
    
    var maliciousPatterns = new[]
    {
        "<script", "javascript:", "onclick=", "onerror=",
        "--", ";", "/*", "*/", "xp_", "sp_", "DROP ", "DELETE ", "UPDATE "
    };
    
    return maliciousPatterns.Any(pattern => 
        input.Contains(pattern, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
}
```

#### **3. User Authorization**

```csharp
// ALWAYS filter by userId at query start
var query = _context.Songs.Where(s => s.UserId == userId);

// Verify user ownership before any operations
var userId = SecureUserContext.GetSanitizedUserId(User);
```

#### **4. Secure Logging**

```csharp
// Sanitize all logged data
var sanitizedGenre = SecureLoggingHelper.SanitizeMessage(genre.Trim());
var sanitizedUserId = SecureLoggingHelper.SanitizeUserId(userId);

_logger.LogInformation(
    "Filtering songs by genre {Genre} for user {UserId}",
    sanitizedGenre, sanitizedUserId);
```

#### **5. SQL Injection Prevention**

```csharp
// ✅ CORRECT: Use Entity Framework LINQ (parameterized)
query = query.Where(s => s.Genre == genre);

// ❌ WRONG: Never concatenate user input
// var sql = $"SELECT * FROM Songs WHERE Genre = '{genre}'";  // DANGEROUS!
```

---

### 📈 **Performance & Scalability**

#### **Performance Targets**

- **API Response Time**: <500ms for all endpoints
- **Database Query Time**: <100ms for filtered queries
- **Genre Filter Query**: <20ms with proper index usage
- **Large Dataset**: Handle 1,000+ songs efficiently

#### **Index Strategy**

```csharp
// DbContext OnModelCreating
builder.Entity<Song>(entity =>
{
    // Composite indexes for filtering
    entity.HasIndex(s => s.UserId);                      // User isolation
    entity.HasIndex(s => new { s.UserId, s.Genre });     // ✅ Genre filtering
    entity.HasIndex(s => new { s.UserId, s.Artist });    // Artist filtering
    entity.HasIndex(s => new { s.UserId, s.Title });     // Title filtering
});
```

#### **Query Performance Comparison**

| Approach | Query Type | Index Usage | Performance (1000 songs) |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Exact Match** | `s.Genre == "Rock"` | ✅ Uses `(UserId, Genre)` index | <20ms ✅ |
| **Case-Insensitive** | `s.Genre.ToLower() == "rock"` | ❌ Full table scan | 50-100ms ❌ |
| **Partial Match** | `s.Genre.Contains("Roc")` | ❌ Full table scan | 100-200ms ❌ |

#### **Caching Strategy**

```csharp
// Cache expensive aggregations
public async Task<IEnumerable<string>> GetGenresAsync(string userId)
{
    return await _cacheService.GetGenresAsync(userId, async () =>
    {
        // Only executes on cache miss
        return await _context.Songs
            .Where(s => s.UserId == userId && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(s.Genre))
            .Select(s => s.Genre!)
            .Distinct()
            .OrderBy(g => g)
            .ToListAsync();
    });
}

// Invalidate cache on mutations
await _cacheService.InvalidateUserCacheAsync(userId);
```

#### **Scalability Thresholds**

- **Current (SQLite)**: 10,000 songs per user, 100 concurrent users
- **Migration Trigger**: Database >50MB or >100 concurrent users
- **Future (PostgreSQL)**: 100,000+ songs, 1,000+ concurrent users
- **Upgrade Path**: Genre lookup table with foreign key relationships

---

### 📚 **Maintainability & Code Conventions**

#### **Pattern Consistency Rules**

**CRITICAL: Apply different strategies based on field type:**

```csharp
// Structured Fields → Exact Match (uses indexes)
if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(genre))
    query = query.Where(s => s.Genre == genre);                    // ✅ Fast

if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(musicalKey))
    query = query.Where(s => s.MusicalKey == musicalKey);          // ✅ Fast

if (difficultyRating.HasValue)
    query = query.Where(s => s.DifficultyRating == difficultyRating); // ✅ Fast

// Free-Text Fields → Partial Match (flexible search)
if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(searchTerm))
{
    var lower = searchTerm.ToLower();
    query = query.Where(s => 
        s.Title.ToLower().Contains(lower) ||                       // Flexible
        s.Artist.ToLower().Contains(lower));                       // Flexible
}
```

#### **Why This Distinction Matters**

- **Structured fields** (Genre, MusicalKey) → Enumerated values from dropdowns → Exact match expected
- **Free-text fields** (Title, Artist) → User-typed search → Partial match needed

#### **Controller Normalization Pattern**

```csharp
// Handle case variations without breaking index usage
private string? NormalizeGenre(string? genre)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(genre)) return null;
    
    // Stored genres are Title Case: "Rock", "Jazz", "Hip-Hop"
    return CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.TextInfo
        .ToTitleCase(genre.Trim().ToLower());
}

// Use in controller:
var normalizedGenre = NormalizeGenre(genre);  // "rock" → "Rock"
var (songs, totalCount) = await _songService.GetSongsAsync(
    userId, 
    genre: normalizedGenre);  // Service receives exact value
```

#### **Testing Pattern**

```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData("Rock")]
[InlineData("Jazz")]
[InlineData("Hip-Hop")]
[InlineData("R&B")]
[InlineData("Death Metal")]
public async Task GetSongsByGenre_WithVariousGenres_FiltersCorrectly(string genre)
{
    // Arrange
    var songs = CreateTestSongs(genre, 3);
    _mockSongService
        .Setup(x => x.GetSongsAsync(TestUserId, null, genre, null, 1, 20))
        .ReturnsAsync((songs, 3));

    // Act
    var result = await _controller.GetSongsByGenre(genre, page: 1, pageSize: 20);

    // Assert
    result.Should().BeOfType<OkObjectResult>();
    // Verify filtering behavior
}
```

#### **Edge Cases to Test**

- Empty/null genre parameters
- SQL injection attempts: `"Rock'; DROP TABLE Songs--"`
- XSS attempts: `"<script>alert('xss')</script>"`
- Invalid pagination: page <= 0, pageSize > 100
- Special characters: `"R&B"`, `"Hip-Hop"`, `"K-Pop"`
- No matching results
- Large datasets (1000+ songs)
- Last page with partial results

### ✨ **User Delight & Business Value**

#### **Musician Workflow Integration**

**Real-World Scenario:**
> *It's Tuesday night, 8 PM. A musician is planning Friday's setlist for a wedding reception. They need to find all their "Jazz" songs to create a sophisticated dinner music set.*

**User Experience Flow:**
1. **Open song library** → Page loads in <2 seconds
2. **Select "Jazz" from genre dropdown** → Populated from `GetGenresAsync()` with cached results
3. **Filter applied instantly** → Query returns in <20ms (indexed)
4. **See 47 Jazz songs** → Pagination shows "Page 1 of 3"
5. **Browse results alphabetically** → Ordered by Artist → Title (predictable)
6. **Add songs to setlist** → Build performance plan with confidence

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ **Fast response** = Professional tool for time-sensitive planning
- ✅ **Predictable results** = "Jazz" returns only Jazz songs (no "Smooth Jazz Fusion" confusion)
- ✅ **Reliable pagination** = Can navigate large libraries efficiently
- ✅ **Dropdown UX** = No typos, no guessing genre names

#### **Business Value Metrics**

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Impact |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Query Performance** | <100ms | <20ms | 5x faster than target ✅ |
| **User Satisfaction** | "Fast enough" | "Instant" | Professional confidence ✅ |
| **Data Accuracy** | Correct results | Exact matching | Zero ambiguity ✅ |
| **Scalability** | 1,000 songs | 10,000 songs | Future-proof ✅ |

#### **Musician-Centric Design Decisions**

**Why Exact Match?**
- Musicians distinguish between "Rock", "Hard Rock", "Alternative Rock" for setlist planning
- Different genres = different performance energy = different audience expectations
- Exact matching respects musical categories as professional tools

**Why Dropdown + Caching?**
- Musicians work backstage with unreliable internet
- Cached genre list loads instantly from memory
- Dropdown prevents typos and ensures valid selections

**Why <20ms Performance?**
- Musicians make quick decisions during rehearsals
- Fast filtering feels "instant" = professional tool
- Slow filtering feels "sluggish" = amateur app

#### **Competitive Advantage**

**Compared to Alternative Approaches:**

| Feature | Setlist Studio | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Genre Filtering** | Exact match | Fuzzy search | Text search |
| **Query Speed** | <20ms | ~200ms | ~500ms |
| **Result Accuracy** | 100% | ~80% | ~60% |
| **Professional Use** | ✅ Reliable | ⚠️ Inconsistent | ❌ Too slow |

#### **Real Musician Feedback** (Hypothetical)

> *"Finally! An app that understands Jazz ≠ Smooth Jazz. When I filter by genre, I get EXACTLY what I need for that vibe. No guessing, no scrolling through wrong results."*
> 
> — Professional Guitarist, Wedding Band

> *"The instant filtering is a game-changer. I can switch between Rock and Country setlists backstage in seconds. That's the speed I need when planning last-minute."*
> 
> — Acoustic Duo Leader

### 🎯 **Implementation Checklist**

When implementing genre filtering (or similar structured field filtering):

- [ ] **Service Layer**: Use exact match (`==`) for structured fields
- [ ] **Controller Layer**: Validate inputs (required, pagination, malicious content)
- [ ] **Database Layer**: Create composite index `(UserId, Genre)`
- [ ] **Security**: Verify user ownership in query, sanitize logs
- [ ] **Performance**: Target <100ms query time, <20ms with index
- [ ] **Caching**: Cache `GetGenresAsync()` results per user
- [ ] **Pagination**: Return tuple `(data, totalCount)`, validate bounds
- [ ] **Testing**: Cover happy path, edge cases, security scenarios
- [ ] **Documentation**: Explain why exact match chosen (performance + UX)
- [ ] **UX Design**: Implement dropdown populated from cached distinct genres

## Security Standards & Guidelines

### MANDATORY Security Requirements

Setlist Studio maintains **strict security standards** that must be followed for all code contributions. Security is not optional - it's a fundamental requirement.

#### Authentication & Authorization

**Password Security Requirements:**
- **Minimum 12 characters** with mixed case, numbers, and special characters
- **Account lockout** after 5 failed attempts for 5 minutes
- **No password hints** or recovery questions
- **Secure password reset** with time-limited tokens

**Session Management:**
- Configure secure cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes
- Use secure cookie names with __Host- prefix
- Set appropriate session timeouts (2 hours max)
- Enable sliding expiration for better UX

**Authorization Checks:**
- **ALWAYS verify user ownership** of resources (songs, setlists)
- **Use resource-based authorization** for entity access
- **Never trust client-side authorization** - validate server-side

#### Input Validation & Sanitization

**CRITICAL: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized**

- Validate all string inputs for length, format, and malicious content
- Use regex patterns for structured data (musical keys, BPM ranges)
- Sanitize inputs to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- Check for malicious patterns (script tags, javascript:, etc.)
- Return meaningful validation error messages
- Never trust client-side validation alone

#### Security Headers (MANDATORY)

**ALL responses must include security headers:**

- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (prevent MIME type sniffing)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY (prevent clickjacking)
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block (XSS protection)
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Content-Security-Policy with restrictive defaults
- Permissions-Policy to disable unnecessary browser features
- Strict-Transport-Security for HTTPS enforcement (production only)

#### Secrets Management (CRITICAL)

**NEVER commit secrets to version control:**

- Never hardcode connection strings, API keys, or passwords in code
- Use Configuration providers (appsettings.json, environment variables)
- Implement Azure Key Vault for production secret management
- Use placeholder values in configuration files (YOUR_CLIENT_ID format)
- Validate that secrets are not placeholder values before using them

#### Rate Limiting & DoS Protection

**REQUIRED: All API endpoints must have rate limiting:**

- Configure rate limiting using Microsoft.AspNetCore.RateLimiting
- Implement different limits for different endpoint types (API: 100/min, Auth: 5/min)
- Use appropriate rate limiting algorithms (FixedWindow, SlidingWindow, etc.)
- Apply rate limiting attributes to controllers and actions
- Configure queue processing and overflow handling

#### Secure Logging Practices

**NEVER log sensitive information:**

- Never log passwords, tokens, API keys, or personal data
- Use user IDs instead of email addresses or names in logs
- Sanitize all logged data to remove sensitive fields
- Implement secure logging utilities that automatically filter sensitive data
- Log security events (failed logins, suspicious activities) appropriately

#### Database Security

**ALWAYS use parameterized queries:**

- Never concatenate user input directly into SQL strings
- Use Entity Framework LINQ queries exclusively for data access
- Always include user ownership validation in data queries
- Implement resource-based authorization for entity access
- Use strongly-typed query parameters to prevent injection attacks

#### CSRF Protection

**ALL state-changing operations must include CSRF protection:**

- Configure anti-forgery tokens with secure settings
- Use secure cookie names with __Host- prefix
- Apply ValidateAntiForgeryToken attribute to state-changing endpoints
- Configure CSRF tokens for AJAX requests
- Use SameSite=Strict and Secure cookie policies

### Security Validation Checklist

**Before submitting any code, verify:**

- [ ] **CodeQL Security Analysis** passes with zero high/critical security issues
  - Run: `codeql database analyze codeql-database --output=security-analysis.sarif codeql/csharp-security-extended.qls`
  - Verify: Results array is empty in SARIF file
- [ ] **Input validation** implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] **Authorization checks** verify user ownership of resources  
- [ ] **Parameterized queries** used exclusively (no string concatenation)
- [ ] **Security headers** configured in middleware
- [ ] **Rate limiting** applied to all API endpoints
- [ ] **Secrets** stored in environment variables or Key Vault
- [ ] **Error messages** don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] **Logging** doesn't expose sensitive data
- [ ] **CSRF protection** enabled for state-changing operations
- [ ] **HTTPS** enforced in production configurations

**Note**: GitHub Actions may report 200+ "findings" from comprehensive quality analysis, but these are mostly code quality improvements, not security vulnerabilities. Focus on the security-specific analysis results.

### Security Code Review Guidelines

**All pull requests must pass security review:**

1. **CodeQL Analysis**: All PRs must pass CodeQL static security analysis with zero high/critical issues
2. **Automated Security Scans**: All PRs trigger comprehensive security vulnerability scans
3. **Manual Security Review**: Security-sensitive changes require manual review
4. **Threat Modeling**: New features require security impact assessment
5. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing of the application

### Security Incident Response

**If a security vulnerability is discovered:**

1. **Immediate Action**: Create private security issue (not public)
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and severity
3. **Remediation**: Develop and test fix
4. **Deployment**: Emergency deployment if critical
5. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders appropriately
6. **Post-Mortem**: Review and improve security processes

## Detailed Security Implementation Guide

This section provides comprehensive, actionable guidance on implementing security patterns in Setlist Studio with specific examples from the musical data context.

### Musical Data Validation Rules

#### **1. BPM (Beats Per Minute) Validation**

**Realistic Range**: 40-250 BPM covers all musical genres from ballads to extreme metal.

**Implementation Pattern:**
```csharp
[SafeBpm(40, 250)]
public int Bpm { get; set; }

// SafeBpmAttribute implementation
public class SafeBpmAttribute : ValidationAttribute
{
    public int MinBpm { get; set; } = 40;
    public int MaxBpm { get; set; } = 250;
    
    protected override ValidationResult? IsValid(object? value, ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        if (value is int bpm)
        {
            if (bpm < MinBpm || bpm > MaxBpm)
                return new ValidationResult($"BPM must be between {MinBpm} and {MaxBpm}");
        }
        return ValidationResult.Success;
    }
}
```

**Why These Limits:**
- **Minimum 40 BPM**: Slowest ballads (e.g., "The Scientist" by Coldplay: 40-50 BPM)
- **Maximum 250 BPM**: Fastest extreme metal/drum & bass (rare but legitimate)
- **Common Ranges**: Ballads (60-80), Pop/Rock (90-140), Punk/Metal (160-200)

**Anti-Pattern Examples:**
```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: No validation (allows negative, unrealistic values)
public int Bpm { get; set; }

// ❌ WRONG: Too restrictive (excludes legitimate ballads and fast songs)
[Range(80, 160)]
public int Bpm { get; set; }

// ❌ WRONG: No upper limit (allows denial of service via integer overflow)
[Range(40, int.MaxValue)]
public int Bpm { get; set; }
```

---

#### **2. Musical Key Validation**

**Valid Keys**: 33 standard Western musical keys (17 major + 16 minor).

**Implementation Pattern:**
```csharp
[MusicalKey]
public string? Key { get; set; }

// MusicalKeyAttribute implementation
public class MusicalKeyAttribute : ValidationAttribute
{
    private static readonly string[] ValidKeys = new[]
    {
        // Major keys (17)
        "C", "C#", "Db", "D", "D#", "Eb", "E", "F", 
        "F#", "Gb", "G", "G#", "Ab", "A", "A#", "Bb", "B",
        
        // Minor keys (16)
        "Cm", "C#m", "Dbm", "Dm", "D#m", "Ebm", "Em", "Fm",
        "F#m", "Gbm", "Gm", "G#m", "Abm", "Am", "A#m", "Bbm", "Bm"
    };
    
    protected override ValidationResult? IsValid(object? value, ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        if (value == null || string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value.ToString()))
            return ValidationResult.Success; // Allow null/empty
            
        var key = value.ToString()!.Trim();
        if (!ValidKeys.Contains(key, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
            return new ValidationResult($"Invalid musical key. Must be one of: {string.Join(", ", ValidKeys)}");
            
        return ValidationResult.Success;
    }
}
```

**Why These Keys:**
- **Enharmonic Equivalents**: Both C# and Db are valid (same pitch, different notation)
- **Minor Keys**: Identified by lowercase 'm' suffix (e.g., "Am" for A minor)
- **No Exotic Modes**: Dorian, Phrygian, etc. should be stored as their parent keys

**Anti-Pattern Examples:**
```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: String validation without whitelist (allows SQL injection)
public string Key { get; set; }

// ❌ WRONG: Case-sensitive comparison (rejects valid "am" for "Am")
if (Key != "Am") throw new ValidationException();

// ❌ WRONG: Overly permissive (allows arbitrary strings)
[StringLength(10)]
public string Key { get; set; }

// ❌ WRONG: Missing enharmonic equivalents (rejects "Db" when only "C#" allowed)
private static readonly string[] ValidKeys = { "C", "C#", "D", ... }; // Missing Db, Eb, etc.
```

---

#### **3. Song Title & Artist Name Validation**

**Requirements**: Prevent XSS, SQL injection, command injection while allowing musical notation.

**Implementation Pattern:**
```csharp
[SafeString(MaxLength = 500, AllowMusicalKeys = true, AllowSpecialCharacters = true)]
public string Title { get; set; } = string.Empty;

[SafeString(MaxLength = 300, AllowMusicalKeys = true, AllowSpecialCharacters = true)]
public string Artist { get; set; } = string.Empty;

// SafeStringAttribute implementation
public class SafeStringAttribute : ValidationAttribute
{
    public int MaxLength { get; set; } = 1000;
    public bool AllowEmpty { get; set; } = false;
    public bool AllowMusicalKeys { get; set; } = false;
    public bool AllowNewlines { get; set; } = false;
    public bool AllowSpecialCharacters { get; set; } = false;
    
    protected override ValidationResult? IsValid(object? value, ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        if (value == null || string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value.ToString()))
        {
            return AllowEmpty ? ValidationResult.Success 
                : new ValidationResult("This field is required");
        }
        
        var input = value.ToString()!;
        
        // Length validation
        if (input.Length > MaxLength)
            return new ValidationResult($"Maximum length is {MaxLength} characters");
        
        // XSS patterns (always blocked)
        var xssPatterns = new[]
        {
            @"<script[^>]*>.*?</script>", @"javascript:", @"vbscript:",
            @"onload\s*=", @"onerror\s*=", @"onclick\s*=", @"onmouseover\s*=",
            @"<iframe", @"<object", @"<embed", @"<form", @"<input"
        };
        
        foreach (var pattern in xssPatterns)
        {
            if (Regex.IsMatch(input, pattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase | RegexOptions.Multiline))
                return new ValidationResult("Input contains potentially dangerous content");
        }
        
        // SQL injection patterns (always blocked)
        var sqlPatterns = new[]
        {
            @"(?:UNION\s+SELECT|DROP\s+TABLE|DELETE\s+FROM|INSERT\s+INTO)",
            @"(?:--|/\*|\*/)", @"(?:'\s*OR\s*'|""\s*OR\s*"")",
            @"(?:OR\s+1\s*=\s*1|OR\s+'1'\s*=\s*'1')"
        };
        
        foreach (var pattern in sqlPatterns)
        {
            if (Regex.IsMatch(input, pattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase))
                return new ValidationResult("Input contains potentially dangerous SQL content");
        }
        
        // Command injection patterns (conditional based on AllowSpecialCharacters)
        if (!AllowSpecialCharacters)
        {
            var commandPatterns = new[]
            {
                @"[;`$(){}[\]\\]", @"\.\./", @"(?:cmd|powershell|bash|sh)\s"
            };
            
            foreach (var pattern in commandPatterns)
            {
                if (Regex.IsMatch(input, pattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase))
                    return new ValidationResult("Input contains invalid characters");
            }
        }
        else
        {
            // Allow & and | for musical notation (e.g., "R&B", "Rock|Alternative")
            // but still block shell metacharacters
            if (Regex.IsMatch(input, @"[;`$(){}[\]\\]|\.\.\/|(?:cmd|powershell|bash|sh)\s", 
                RegexOptions.IgnoreCase))
                return new ValidationResult("Input contains invalid characters");
        }
        
        // Log injection patterns (conditional based on AllowNewlines)
        if (!AllowNewlines && input.Any(c => c < 32 && c != 9)) // Allow tab (9)
            return new ValidationResult("Input contains control characters");
        
        return ValidationResult.Success;
    }
}
```

**Musical Context Considerations:**
- **Allow apostrophes**: "Rock 'n' Roll", "Guns N' Roses"
- **Allow ampersands**: "Simon & Garfunkel", "R&B"
- **Allow pipes**: "Rock|Alternative" for genre classification
- **Allow dashes/hyphens**: "Hip-Hop", "K-Pop"
- **Allow parentheses in display**: "Remastered (2023 Edition)"

**Anti-Pattern Examples:**
```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: No validation (XSS, SQL injection vulnerable)
public string Title { get; set; }

// ❌ WRONG: Blocks legitimate musical characters
[RegularExpression(@"^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]+$")] // Rejects "Rock 'n' Roll", "R&B"
public string Artist { get; set; }

// ❌ WRONG: Only client-side validation (bypassable)
// Client: <input type="text" maxlength="500" required />
// Server: public string Title { get; set; } // No validation!

// ❌ WRONG: Strips characters instead of rejecting (data loss)
public string Title 
{ 
    get => _title; 
    set => _title = Regex.Replace(value, @"[<>]", ""); // Loses user intent
}
```

---

#### **4. Genre Validation**

**Approach**: Use enumeration or database whitelist for structured data.

**Implementation Pattern:**
```csharp
// Option 1: Enum-based (compile-time safety)
public enum Genre
{
    Rock, Pop, Jazz, Blues, Country, Folk, Classical,
    HipHop, Electronic, Metal, Punk, Alternative, Indie,
    RnB, Soul, Funk, Disco, Reggae, Latin, World,
    DeathMetal, HeavyMetal, ProgressiveRock
}

[Required]
public Genre Genre { get; set; }

// Option 2: Database whitelist (runtime flexibility)
[SafeString(MaxLength = 100)]
public string? Genre { get; set; }

// In service layer:
private static readonly HashSet<string> ValidGenres = new(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
{
    "Rock", "Pop", "Jazz", "Blues", "Country", "Folk", "Classical",
    "Hip-Hop", "Electronic", "Metal", "Punk", "Alternative", "Indie",
    "R&B", "Soul", "Funk", "Disco", "Reggae", "Latin", "World",
    "Death Metal", "Heavy Metal", "Progressive Rock"
};

public async Task<Song> CreateSongAsync(CreateSongRequest request, string userId)
{
    if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(request.Genre) && 
        !ValidGenres.Contains(request.Genre))
    {
        throw new ValidationException($"Invalid genre. Valid genres: {string.Join(", ", ValidGenres)}");
    }
    // ... create song
}
```

**Why Whitelist Validation:**
- **Exact Matching**: Ensures consistent genre classification
- **Performance**: Enables database index usage for filtering
- **User Experience**: Dropdown selection prevents typos
- **Caching**: Genre list can be cached for fast retrieval

**Anti-Pattern Examples:**
```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: Free-text genre (inconsistent data)
public string Genre { get; set; } // Allows "rock", "Rock", "ROCK", "Rokc"

// ❌ WRONG: No validation (allows SQL injection)
var genre = request.Genre;
var songs = await _db.ExecuteSqlRawAsync($"SELECT * FROM Songs WHERE Genre = '{genre}'");

// ❌ WRONG: Case-sensitive comparison (rejects valid inputs)
if (request.Genre != "Rock") throw new ValidationException();

// ❌ WRONG: Overly permissive regex (allows arbitrary strings)
[RegularExpression(@"^[a-zA-Z\s-]+$")] // Allows "DELETE FROM Songs"
public string Genre { get; set; }
```

---

### Authorization Patterns for Musical Data

#### **1. Resource-Based Authorization (User Ownership)**

**CRITICAL**: Every data access MUST verify user ownership.

**Implementation Pattern:**
```csharp
// ✅ CORRECT: SongsController.GetSong()
[HttpGet("{id}")]
[Authorize]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetSong(int id)
{
    // 1. Extract authenticated user ID
    var userId = User.Identity?.Name ?? throw new UnauthorizedAccessException();
    
    // 2. Retrieve resource with user ownership validation
    var song = await _songService.GetByIdAsync(id, userId);
    
    // 3. Verify ownership (service returns null if not owned by user)
    if (song == null)
        return NotFound(new { error = "Song not found or access denied" });
    
    return Ok(song);
}

// SongService.GetByIdAsync()
public async Task<Song?> GetByIdAsync(int songId, string userId)
{
    // ALWAYS filter by userId in query
    return await _context.Songs
        .Where(s => s.Id == songId && s.UserId == userId)
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **Prevents Horizontal Privilege Escalation**: User A cannot access User B's songs
- **Defense in Depth**: Authorization at controller AND service layer
- **Explicit Ownership**: Every query includes `UserId` filter

**Anti-Pattern Examples:**
```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: No user ownership check (horizontal privilege escalation)
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetSong(int id)
{
    var song = await _context.Songs.FindAsync(id); // Missing userId filter!
    return Ok(song);
}

// ❌ WRONG: Client-side authorization only
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetSong(int id, [FromQuery] string userId)
{
    // Never trust userId from query parameters!
    var song = await _context.Songs.FirstAsync(s => s.Id == id && s.UserId == userId);
    return Ok(song);
}

// ❌ WRONG: Authorization after data retrieval
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetSong(int id)
{
    var song = await _context.Songs.FindAsync(id); // Retrieves any user's song
    var userId = User.Identity?.Name;
    if (song.UserId != userId) return Forbid(); // Too late! Data already accessed
    return Ok(song);
}

// ❌ WRONG: Missing [Authorize] attribute (allows anonymous access)
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetSong(int id)
{
    // ... implementation
}
```

---

#### **2. Operation-Level Authorization (CRUD Operations)**

**Pattern**: Verify user can perform specific operation on specific resource.

**Implementation Pattern:**
```csharp
// ✅ CORRECT: SongsController.UpdateSong()
[HttpPut("{id}")]
[Authorize]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateSong(int id, [FromBody] UpdateSongRequest request)
{
    var userId = User.Identity?.Name ?? throw new UnauthorizedAccessException();
    
    try
    {
        // Verify ownership before update
        var existingSong = await _songService.GetByIdAsync(id, userId);
        if (existingSong == null)
            return NotFound(new { error = "Song not found or access denied" });
        
        // Perform update with ownership validation
        var updated = await _songService.UpdateAsync(id, request, userId);
        return Ok(updated);
    }
    catch (UnauthorizedAccessException)
    {
        return Forbid();
    }
}

// ✅ CORRECT: SongsController.DeleteSong()
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
[Authorize]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteSong(int id)
{
    var userId = User.Identity?.Name ?? throw new UnauthorizedAccessException();
    
    try
    {
        var deleted = await _songService.DeleteAsync(id, userId);
        if (!deleted)
            return NotFound(new { error = "Song not found or access denied" });
        
        return NoContent();
    }
    catch (UnauthorizedAccessException)
    {
        return Forbid();
    }
}

// SongService.DeleteAsync() with soft delete
public async Task<bool> DeleteAsync(int songId, string userId)
{
    var song = await _context.Songs
        .Where(s => s.Id == songId && s.UserId == userId)
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
    
    if (song == null)
        return false; // Not found or unauthorized
    
    // Soft delete (recommended for audit trail)
    song.IsDeleted = true;
    song.DeletedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;
    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    
    return true;
}
```

**Anti-Pattern Examples:**
```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: Missing CSRF protection on state-changing operation
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
[Authorize]
// Missing [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]!
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteSong(int id)
{
    // Vulnerable to CSRF attacks
}

// ❌ WRONG: No ownership verification before delete
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
[Authorize]
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteSong(int id)
{
    await _context.Songs.Where(s => s.Id == id).ExecuteDeleteAsync(); // Deletes ANY user's song!
    return NoContent();
}

// ❌ WRONG: Exposing whether resource exists for other users (information disclosure)
[HttpGet("{id}")]
[Authorize]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetSong(int id)
{
    var song = await _context.Songs.FindAsync(id);
    if (song == null)
        return NotFound("Song not found"); // Different message!
    
    var userId = User.Identity?.Name;
    if (song.UserId != userId)
        return Forbid("You don't own this song"); // Reveals song exists!
    
    return Ok(song);
}
// ✅ CORRECT: Same error message for both cases
return NotFound(new { error = "Song not found or access denied" });
```

#### **3. Setlist Collaboration Authorization**

**Future Feature**: Allow band members to collaborate on shared setlists.

**Implementation Pattern:**
```csharp
// SetlistCollaborator entity
public class SetlistCollaborator
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int SetlistId { get; set; }
    public string UserId { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public CollaboratorRole Role { get; set; }
    public DateTime InvitedAt { get; set; }
}

public enum CollaboratorRole
{
    Owner,      // Full control
    Editor,     // Can modify setlist
    Viewer      // Read-only access
}

// Authorization service
public async Task<bool> CanAccessSetlistAsync(int setlistId, string userId, CollaboratorRole minimumRole)
{
    var collaborator = await _context.SetlistCollaborators
        .Where(c => c.SetlistId == setlistId && c.UserId == userId)
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
    
    if (collaborator == null)
        return false;
    
    return collaborator.Role >= minimumRole;
}

// SetlistsController usage
[HttpPut("{id}")]
[Authorize]
public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateSetlist(int id, [FromBody] UpdateSetlistRequest request)
{
    var userId = User.Identity?.Name ?? throw new UnauthorizedAccessException();
    
    // Check editor or owner permission
    var canEdit = await _authorizationService.CanAccessSetlistAsync(id, userId, CollaboratorRole.Editor);
    if (!canEdit)
        return Forbid();
    
    var updated = await _setlistService.UpdateAsync(id, request);
    return Ok(updated);
}
```

**Anti-Pattern Examples:**
```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: Overly permissive (any authenticated user can edit)
[HttpPut("{id}")]
[Authorize]
public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateSetlist(int id, [FromBody] UpdateSetlistRequest request)
{
    var setlist = await _context.Setlists.FindAsync(id); // No ownership check!
    // ... update
}

// ❌ WRONG: Hardcoded roles (inflexible, not scalable)
if (User.IsInRole("Admin") || User.IsInRole("BandLeader"))
{
    // ... allow access
}

// ❌ WRONG: Missing audit trail for shared access
public async Task AddCollaboratorAsync(int setlistId, string userId, CollaboratorRole role)
{
    await _context.SetlistCollaborators.AddAsync(new SetlistCollaborator
    {
        SetlistId = setlistId,
        UserId = userId,
        Role = role
        // Missing: InvitedBy, InvitedAt, AcceptedAt
    });
}
```

---

### Common Security Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

#### **1. Input Validation Anti-Patterns**

**❌ Trusting Client-Side Validation Only:**
```csharp
// Client-side (HTML)
<input type="number" min="40" max="250" required />

// Server-side (WRONG - no validation!)
public int Bpm { get; set; }
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Client-side validation can be bypassed using browser dev tools or API calls.

---

**❌ Sanitizing Instead of Rejecting:**
```csharp
// WRONG: Data loss and potential bypass
public string Title
{
    get => _title;
    set => _title = value.Replace("<", "").Replace(">", ""); // Loses user intent
}
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Sanitization can be bypassed (e.g., `<<script>script>`) and loses user data.

---

**❌ Blacklist Instead of Whitelist:**
```csharp
// WRONG: Incomplete blacklist (easily bypassed)
if (input.Contains("<script>") || input.Contains("DROP TABLE"))
{
    throw new ValidationException();
}
// Bypass: "<SCRIPT>", "drop table", "dRoP tAbLe"
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Attackers find creative bypasses. Use whitelists for structured data.

---

#### **2. Authorization Anti-Patterns**

**❌ Missing [Authorize] Attribute:**
```csharp
// WRONG: Allows anonymous access
[HttpGet]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetUserSongs()
{
    var userId = User.Identity?.Name; // null for anonymous!
    var songs = await _songService.GetByUserIdAsync(userId);
    return Ok(songs);
}
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Sensitive endpoints accessible without authentication.

---

**❌ Trusting User-Provided IDs:**
```csharp
// WRONG: Horizontal privilege escalation
[HttpGet]
[Authorize]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetSongs([FromQuery] string userId)
{
    // Attacker can request any user's songs!
    var songs = await _songService.GetByUserIdAsync(userId);
    return Ok(songs);
}
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Users can access other users' data by changing query parameters.

---

**❌ Authorization After Data Retrieval:**
```csharp
// WRONG: Data accessed before authorization check
var song = await _context.Songs.FindAsync(id); // Retrieves from database
if (song.UserId != userId) return Forbid(); // Too late!
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Timing attacks, logging exposure, defense in depth violation.

---

#### **3. Database Security Anti-Patterns**

**❌ String Concatenation in Queries:**
```csharp
// WRONG: SQL injection vulnerability
var genre = request.Genre;
var query = $"SELECT * FROM Songs WHERE Genre = '{genre}'";
var songs = await _context.Database.ExecuteSqlRawAsync(query);
// Attack: genre = "'; DROP TABLE Songs--"
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Direct SQL injection leading to data breach or destruction.

---

**❌ Using ToLower() in Service Layer:**
```csharp
// WRONG: Breaks database index usage
var songs = await _context.Songs
    .Where(s => s.Genre.ToLower() == genre.ToLower()) // Full table scan!
    .ToListAsync();
```
**Why It's Wrong**: ToLower() prevents index usage, causing severe performance degradation.

---

**❌ N+1 Query Problem:**
```csharp
// WRONG: Multiple database round-trips
var setlists = await _context.Setlists.ToListAsync();
foreach (var setlist in setlists)
{
    setlist.Songs = await _context.Songs
        .Where(s => s.SetlistId == setlist.Id)
        .ToListAsync(); // N queries!
}
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Performance disaster with large datasets.

---

#### **4. Error Handling Anti-Patterns**

**❌ Exposing Stack Traces:**
```csharp
// WRONG: Information disclosure
catch (Exception ex)
{
    return BadRequest(ex.Message); // Exposes internal details!
}
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Reveals system architecture, file paths, technology stack to attackers.

---

**❌ Different Error Messages:**
```csharp
// WRONG: User enumeration vulnerability
var user = await _userManager.FindByEmailAsync(email);
if (user == null)
    return NotFound("User not found"); // Different message!
if (!await _userManager.CheckPasswordAsync(user, password))
    return Unauthorized("Invalid password"); // Confirms user exists!
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Attacker can enumerate valid usernames/emails.

---

**❌ Logging Sensitive Data:**
```csharp
// WRONG: PII in logs
_logger.LogInformation("User {Email} logged in with password {Password}", 
    user.Email, password);
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Exposes sensitive data in log files.

---

#### **5. Secrets Management Anti-Patterns**

**❌ Hardcoded Secrets:**
```csharp
// WRONG: Secret in source code
var connectionString = "Server=prod.db;User=admin;Password=P@ssw0rd123";
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Committed to version control, visible in plain text.

---

**❌ Secrets in Configuration Files:**
```json
// appsettings.json (WRONG)
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Default": "Server=prod;User=sa;Password=RealPassword123"
  }
}
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Configuration files often committed to repositories.

---

**❌ Using Placeholder Values in Production:**
```csharp
// WRONG: No validation
var clientId = _configuration["OAuth:Google:ClientId"];
// Uses placeholder "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" in production!
```
**Why It's Wrong**: Application fails silently with placeholder values.

---

### Security Testing Patterns

#### **1. Malicious Input Testing**

**Test XSS Attempts:**
```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData("<script>alert('xss')</script>")]
[InlineData("javascript:alert('xss')")]
[InlineData("<img src=x onerror='alert(1)'>")]
[InlineData("';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//")]
public async Task CreateSong_WithXSSPayload_ReturnsValidationError(string maliciousTitle)
{
    var request = new CreateSongRequest
    {
        Title = maliciousTitle,
        Artist = "Test Artist",
        Bpm = 120
    };
    
    var result = await _controller.CreateSong(request);
    
    result.Should().BeOfType<BadRequestObjectResult>();
}
```

---

**Test SQL Injection Attempts:**
```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData("'; DROP TABLE Songs--")]
[InlineData("' OR '1'='1")]
[InlineData("'; DELETE FROM Songs WHERE '1'='1")]
[InlineData("UNION SELECT * FROM Users--")]
public async Task GetSongsByGenre_WithSQLInjection_ReturnsBadRequest(string maliciousGenre)
{
    var result = await _controller.GetSongsByGenre(maliciousGenre);
    
    result.Should().BeOfType<BadRequestObjectResult>();
    var response = (result as BadRequestObjectResult)?.Value as dynamic;
    response?.error.ToString().Should().Contain("Invalid genre");
}
```

---

**Test Command Injection Attempts:**
```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData("Song Title; rm -rf /")]
[InlineData("Artist Name && cat /etc/passwd")]
[InlineData("Title | powershell -Command Get-Process")]
public async Task CreateSong_WithCommandInjection_ReturnsValidationError(string maliciousInput)
{
    var request = new CreateSongRequest
    {
        Title = maliciousInput,
        Artist = "Test",
        Bpm = 120
    };
    
    var result = await _controller.CreateSong(request);
    
    result.Should().BeOfType<BadRequestObjectResult>();
}
```

---

#### **2. Authorization Testing**

**Test Horizontal Privilege Escalation:**
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task GetSong_WithDifferentUsersSong_ReturnsNotFound()
{
    // Arrange: Create song owned by User A
    var userASong = await _songService.CreateAsync(new CreateSongRequest
    {
        Title = "User A Song",
        Artist = "Artist",
        Bpm = 120
    }, userIdA);
    
    // Act: User B tries to access User A's song
    _mockHttpContextAccessor.Setup(x => x.HttpContext.User.Identity.Name)
        .Returns(userIdB);
    
    var result = await _controller.GetSong(userASong.Id);
    
    // Assert: Access denied
    result.Should().BeOfType<NotFoundObjectResult>();
}
```

---

**Test Missing Authorization:**
```csharp
[Fact]
public void SongsController_AllEndpoints_HaveAuthorizeAttribute()
{
    var controller = typeof(SongsController);
    var methods = controller.GetMethods(BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance)
        .Where(m => m.GetCustomAttributes<HttpMethodAttribute>().Any());
    
    foreach (var method in methods)
    {
        var hasAuthorize = method.GetCustomAttribute<AuthorizeAttribute>() != null
            || controller.GetCustomAttribute<AuthorizeAttribute>() != null;
        
        hasAuthorize.Should().BeTrue(
            $"Method {method.Name} should have [Authorize] attribute");
    }
}
```

---

#### **3. Rate Limiting Testing**

**Test Rate Limit Enforcement:**
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task CreateSong_ExceedsRateLimit_ReturnsTooManyRequests()
{
    // Arrange: Configure rate limiter for testing
    var requests = new List<Task<IActionResult>>();
    
    // Act: Make 101 requests (limit is 100/min)
    for (int i = 0; i < 101; i++)
    {
        requests.Add(_controller.CreateSong(new CreateSongRequest
        {
            Title = $"Song {i}",
            Artist = "Artist",
            Bpm = 120
        }));
    }
    
    var results = await Task.WhenAll(requests);
    
    // Assert: Last request should be rate limited
    results.Last().Should().BeOfType<StatusCodeResult>()
        .Which.StatusCode.Should().Be(429); // Too Many Requests
}
```

## Quick Start Guide

When contributing to Setlist Studio:

1. **Read the codebase**: Familiarize yourself with existing patterns and conventions
2. **Follow the principles**: Keep reliability, scalability, **security**, maintainability, and delight in mind
3. **Security first**: Always implement security requirements (validation, authorization, secure headers, rate limiting) before adding functionality
4. **CodeQL compliance**: Generate code that passes CodeQL static analysis with zero high/critical security issues and follows best practices (null safety, LINQ usage, resource disposal)
5. **Match tests to source files**: Every test file must correspond to exactly one source code file using the `{SourceClass}Tests.cs` naming pattern
6. **Use realistic examples**: When creating tests or documentation, use authentic musical data
7. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure your code works correctly and handles edge cases with 80%+ line and branch coverage
8. **Organize tests strategically**: 
   - Add core functionality tests to base test files (e.g., `SetlistServiceTests.cs`)
   - Create advanced test files for edge cases, error handling, and coverage gaps when base files exceed ~1,400 lines
   - Use the `{SourceClass}AdvancedTests.cs` naming pattern for specialized testing scenarios
9. **Target coverage gaps**: Use coverage reports to identify areas needing additional testing and create focused advanced test suites
10. **Security validation**: Complete the security checklist before submitting any pull request
11. **Document your work**: Add clear comments and update documentation as needed

## FINAL ENFORCEMENT REMINDER

**Every time you create or modify tests, you MUST:**

1. **CHECK FIRST**: Use `file_search` to verify if `{SourceClass}Tests.cs` exists
2. **ENHANCE EXISTING**: Add to base test file before creating new files
3. **FOLLOW NAMING**: Only use `{SourceClass}Tests.cs` or `{SourceClass}AdvancedTests.cs`
4. **NO CUSTOM NAMES**: Never create "FocusedTests", "CoverageTests", "SpecializedTests", etc.
5. **VALIDATE SIZE**: Create advanced tests only when base file exceeds 1,400 lines

**This is not optional - it's mandatory for all test file operations.**

---

## SECURITY ENFORCEMENT REMINDER

**Security is MANDATORY - not optional. Every contribution must:**

1. **PASS CODEQL SECURITY ANALYSIS**: All code must pass CodeQL security-focused analysis with zero high/critical issues
   - Run: `codeql database analyze codeql-database --output=security-analysis.sarif codeql/csharp-security-extended.qls`
   - Verify: Empty results array in SARIF file
2. **VALIDATE ALL INPUTS**: No user input is trusted without validation and sanitization
3. **AUTHORIZE ALL ACCESS**: Every data access must verify user ownership
4. **USE SECURE DEFAULTS**: Security headers, HTTPS, secure cookies are required
5. **PROTECT SECRETS**: Never hardcode credentials - use secure storage
6. **PREVENT ATTACKS**: Guard against XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, and DoS attacks
7. **LOG SECURELY**: Never log sensitive data, always sanitize log entries
8. **FAIL SECURELY**: Error messages must not leak sensitive information

**Note**: GitHub's comprehensive analysis may show hundreds of code quality findings while security analysis shows zero vulnerabilities. This is expected - focus on security-specific results for security compliance.

**Security violations will result in immediate pull request rejection.**

## CODEQL ENFORCEMENT REMINDER

**CodeQL compliance is MANDATORY - not optional. Every code contribution must:**

1. **PASS CODEQL SECURITY ANALYSIS**: All code must pass CodeQL security-focused analysis with zero high/critical issues
   - Run: `codeql database analyze codeql-database --output=security-analysis.sarif codeql/csharp-security-extended.qls`
   - Verify: Empty results array in SARIF file
2. **USE NULL SAFETY**: Implement proper null handling with `?.`, `!`, and explicit nullable casts
3. **OPTIMIZE WITH LINQ**: Replace foreach loops with LINQ methods where appropriate
4. **DISPOSE RESOURCES**: Use `using` statements for all IDisposable objects
5. **VALIDATE INPUTS**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
6. **AVOID USELESS ASSIGNMENTS**: Don't create variables that are assigned but never used
7. **FOLLOW PATTERNS**: Use established security and quality patterns consistently
8. **VERIFY LOCALLY**: Run CodeQL analysis before submitting pull requests

**Note**: GitHub Actions may report 200+ "findings" from comprehensive quality analysis, but these are mostly code quality improvements, not security vulnerabilities. Focus on the security-specific analysis results.

**CodeQL violations will result in immediate pull request rejection.**

## SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

**Current System Limits & Growth Planning:**

### **Database Scalability**
- **SQLite Current Limit**: ~100 concurrent users, ~50MB database files
- **Migration Threshold**: Plan PostgreSQL migration when database >50MB or >100 concurrent users
- **Index Strategy**: All user-specific queries have appropriate indexes (UserId, Artist, Genre, PerformanceDate)
- **Query Performance**: All queries must complete within 100ms; optimize with proper Entity Framework usage

### **Application Scalability**
- **Blazor Server Limits**: ~200 concurrent connections per instance, 2-4MB memory per connection
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Implement Redis distributed caching and sticky sessions for load balancing
- **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage patterns, implement proper resource disposal
- **Background Processing**: Use background jobs for heavy operations (calculations, aggregations)

### **Performance Monitoring**
- **API Response Times**: <500ms for all endpoints under normal load
- **Database Query Performance**: Monitor with Entity Framework logging and optimize N+1 problems
- **Memory Usage**: Track per-user memory consumption and implement distributed caching at 1GB+
- **Connection Limits**: Plan for database connection pooling when approaching 100+ concurrent users

### **Scaling Roadmap**
1. **Phase 1 (100-300 users)**: Optimize existing SQLite with indexes and caching
2. **Phase 2 (300-1000 users)**: Migrate to PostgreSQL with connection pooling
3. **Phase 3 (1000+ users)**: Implement Redis caching and load balancing
4. **Phase 4 (5000+ users)**: Add read replicas and horizontal scaling
