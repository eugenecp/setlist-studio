- **RESTful APIs**: Well-designed endpoints for seamless data interaction
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user management and access control
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed application monitoring and debugging capabilities
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage for artists, songs, setlists, and performance data
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing suites

### Development Workflow
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipelines for building, testing, and deployment
- **Version Control**: Git-based workflow with feature branches and pull request reviews

## UI and Design Standards

Setlist Studio includes both web and mobile applications with a clean, modern design system. When generating UI components and screens, follow these comprehensive design guidelines:

### Core Design System
- **Design Language**: Material Design 3 guidelines for spacing, typography, and color palettes
- **Styling Framework**: Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling
- **Component Library**: ShadCN UI components for cards, buttons, modals, and inputs
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library
- **Typography**: Clean fonts (Inter or Roboto family)

### Main Screen Requirements

Generate clean, modern UI designs for these core screens:

1. **Login/Signup**: User authentication flow with form validation
2. **Dashboard**: Song lists with search, filtering, and organization
3. **Song Detail View**: Display lyrics, chords, and performance notes
4. **Create/Edit Setlist Flow**: Drag-and-drop setlist builder interface
5. **Player Screen**: Performance view for executing setlists during shows

### Design Rules and Standards

**Layout and Responsiveness:**
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Seamless adaptation for tablets and desktop screens
- Consistent spacing and grid systems across all breakpoints

**Accessibility:**
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Proper color contrast ratios and focus indicators
- Screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation support

**Visual Design:**
- Primary action buttons must be consistent and highly visible
- Include comprehensive dark mode support with proper color schemes
- Design all interactive states: hover, active, focus, and error states

**Code Requirements:**
- Generate component structures using React + Tailwind CSS
- Output complete JSX code with styled UI components
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces and props where applicable
- Ensure components are reusable and maintainable

### UI Component Examples

When creating UI components, structure them like this:

```jsx
// Example: Song Card Component
interface SongCardProps {
  title: string;
  artist: string;
  bpm?: number;
  key?: string;
  duration?: string;
  onEdit?: () => void;
  onDelete?: () => void;
}

const SongCard: React.FC<SongCardProps> = ({ 
  title, artist, bpm, key, duration, onEdit, onDelete 
}) => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4 hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
      {/* Component content with Tailwind classes */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Key Principles

When working with Setlist Studio, please adhere to these core principles:

### 1. Reliability üõ°Ô∏è
Every feature must work consistently and predictably. All functionality should be thoroughly tested and handle edge cases gracefully.

**Guidelines:**
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new features
- Implement proper error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Ensure database transactions are atomic and consistent
- Test boundary conditions (empty setlists, maximum song limits, etc.)

### 2. Scalability üìà
The application must handle growth in songs, setlists, users, and performance data as the user base expands.

**Guidelines:**
- Design efficient database queries and indexing strategies
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Use caching where appropriate to reduce database load
- Structure code to support horizontal scaling when needed

### 3. Security üîí
Protect user data and maintain system integrity through robust security practices.

**Guidelines:**
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides
- Never store secrets, API keys, or sensitive data in source code
- Use environment variables and secure configuration management
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Sanitize data to prevent injection attacks

### 4. Maintainability üîß
Keep the codebase organized, well-documented, and easy to understand for current and future developers.

**Guidelines:**
- Follow consistent naming conventions and coding standards
- Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable and method names
- Maintain up-to-date documentation for APIs and complex business logic
- Organize code into logical modules and maintain separation of concerns
- Keep dependencies up to date and minimize technical debt

### 5. Delight ‚ú®
Create an enjoyable user experience with realistic, relatable content and smooth interactions.

**Guidelines:**
- Use realistic music examples in documentation, tests, and sample data
- Include diverse genres, artists, and musical styles in examples
- Provide helpful default values (e.g., common BPM ranges, popular keys)
- Create intuitive user interfaces and clear user feedback
- Use authentic musical terminology and metadata

## Example Prompts for GitHub Copilot
