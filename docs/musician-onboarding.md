## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I Can't Access My Setlists"
**Solution**: Check you're logged in with the same OAuth account (Google/Microsoft/Facebook) you used to create them.

### "App Won't Load During Performance"
**Solution**: Use offline mode - download your setlists before the gig when you have good internet.

### "Sharing Setlists with Band"
**Solutions**: 
- Export as PDF for easy sharing
- Email JSON backup for importing 
- Use same OAuth login for all band members

### "Moving from Paper Setlists"
**Migration Tip**: Start with one gig at a time. Don't try to digitize your entire catalog immediately.
