# Enhanced Rate Limiting System

This document describes the enhanced rate limiting system implemented to address security concerns about rate limiting bypass potential through IP rotation, proxies, and distributed attacks.

## Overview

The enhanced rate limiting system implements multiple security layers:

1. **Multi-Factor Rate Limiting** - Uses multiple factors (IP, User, Session, User Agent, Network Segment) for partition keys
2. **CAPTCHA Integration** - Automatically challenges suspicious requests with CAPTCHA verification
3. **Enhanced Monitoring** - Comprehensive logging and violation tracking
4. **Adaptive Policies** - Different rate limits based on authentication status and endpoint sensitivity

## Security Improvements

### Previous Implementation Issues

The original rate limiting implementation had several vulnerabilities:

- **IP-only partitioning** - Could be bypassed through IP rotation/proxies
- **No behavioral analysis** - Didn't detect suspicious patterns
- **No CAPTCHA challenges** - Automated attacks could continue undetected
- **Limited monitoring** - Insufficient logging for security analysis

### Enhanced Security Features

#### 1. Multi-Factor Partitioning

The system now creates composite partition keys using multiple factors:

```csharp
// Factors considered for partition key:
- User Identity (authenticated users)
- IP Address (including forwarded headers)
- Session ID (session-based tracking)
- User Agent fingerprint (detect automation)
- Network Segment (subnet-based limiting)
```

#### 2. CAPTCHA Integration

Automatic CAPTCHA challenges are triggered by:

- **Multiple rate limit violations** (3+ in an hour)
- **Suspicious user agents** (bots, crawlers, automation tools)
- **Distributed attack patterns** (multiple IPs from same network)
- **High-velocity requests** (100+ requests per minute)
- **Authentication failures** (3+ failed logins)

#### 3. Enhanced Rate Limiting Policies

Different policies for different security contexts:

- **AuthPolicy** - Authentication endpoints (5 req/min)
- **ApiPolicy** - Public API endpoints (100 req/min)
- **AuthenticatedApiPolicy** - Authenticated API users (200 req/min)
- **AuthenticatedPolicy** - Authenticated users (2000 req/min)
- **SensitivePolicy** - Sensitive operations (25 req/min)
- **StrictPolicy** - High-risk endpoints (10 req/min)

#### 4. Comprehensive Security Monitoring

Enhanced logging includes:

- **Violation tracking** - Detailed records of rate limit violations
- **Security event correlation** - Links violations to attack patterns
- **Real-time alerting** - Automatic alerts for security thresholds
- **Behavioral analysis** - Detection of automation and abuse patterns

## Architecture

### Components

#### EnhancedRateLimitingService

Core service that provides:
- Composite partition key generation
- CAPTCHA requirement assessment
- Rate limit policy selection
- Violation recording and monitoring
- CAPTCHA validation

#### CaptchaMiddleware

Middleware that enforces CAPTCHA challenges:
- Intercepts requests requiring CAPTCHA
- Validates CAPTCHA responses
- Manages bypass tokens
- Returns appropriate challenge responses

#### Rate Limiting Attributes

Declarative attributes for controllers:
- `[EnableRateLimiting(RateLimitPolicies.AuthenticatedApi)]`
- `[SecurityRateLimitConfig(EnableSecurityLogging = true)]`

### Integration Points

#### Program.cs Configuration

```csharp
// Enhanced rate limiting service registration
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IEnhancedRateLimitingService, EnhancedRateLimitingService>();

// Rate limiter configuration with composite partitioning
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(options =>
{
    options.GlobalLimiter = PartitionedRateLimiter.Create<HttpContext, string>(httpContext =>
    {
        var rateLimitingService = httpContext.RequestServices.GetService<IEnhancedRateLimitingService>();
        var partitionKey = rateLimitingService?.GetCompositePartitionKeyAsync(httpContext).Result 
                          ?? GetSafePartitionKey(httpContext);
        
        return RateLimitPartition.GetFixedWindowLimiter(partitionKey, /* ... */);
    });
});

// CAPTCHA middleware placement
app.UseCaptchaMiddleware(); // After rate limiter, before static files
```

#### Controller Usage

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
[EnableRateLimiting(RateLimitPolicies.AuthenticatedApi)]
[SecurityRateLimitConfig(EnableSecurityLogging = true, BlockSuspiciousUserAgents = true)]
public class ArtistsController : ControllerBase
{
    // Controller actions...
}
```

## Security Analysis

### Attack Mitigation

#### IP Rotation/Proxy Bypass

**Before:** Attackers could bypass rate limits by rotating IP addresses or using proxy services.

**After:** Multi-factor partitioning includes user agent fingerprinting, session tracking, and network segment analysis, making IP rotation ineffective.

#### Distributed Attacks

**Before:** Attacks from multiple IPs in the same network segment were not correlated.

**After:** Network segment limiting and distributed attack pattern detection identify and mitigate coordinated attacks.

#### Automation Detection

**Before:** No mechanism to detect automated vs. human traffic.

**After:** User agent analysis, behavioral patterns, and CAPTCHA challenges effectively distinguish between legitimate users and automation.

### Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead** - Composite key generation is optimized with caching
- **Efficient CAPTCHA** - Only challenges suspicious requests, not all traffic
- **Memory usage** - Bounded violation tracking with automatic cleanup
- **Scalability** - Distributed caching support for multi-instance deployments

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Metrics

The system tracks:

- **Violation rates** - Per IP, user, and endpoint
- **CAPTCHA challenges** - Challenge rates and success rates
- **Attack patterns** - Distributed attacks, automation attempts
- **Bypass attempts** - Failed CAPTCHA validations, suspicious patterns

### Log Analysis

Sample security log entries:

```
[Warning] Rate limit violation recorded: PartitionKey=abc123, ClientIp=192.168.1.100, Endpoint=/api/songs
[Critical] SECURITY ALERT: IP 192.168.1.100 has exceeded violation threshold with 10 violations
[Information] CAPTCHA challenge passed for IP 192.168.1.100
[Warning] Invalid CAPTCHA response from IP 192.168.1.100
```
