- âœ… **Recovery processes** for connection restoration

## Technical Architecture

### Caching Strategy
```
Critical Resources (Cache-First):
- App shell: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Images and icons
- PWA manifest and offline page

Dynamic Content (Network-First with Cache Fallback):
- Setlists API: /api/setlists
- Songs API: /api/songs  
- Search API: /api/setlists/search, /api/songs/search

Excluded from Cache:
- Authentication endpoints
- Real-time data (Blazor SignalR)
- User-generated content uploads
```

### Storage Approach
- **Service Worker cache** for API responses and static resources
- **LocalStorage** for JSON serialized setlist data
- **Automatic cleanup** of old cached content
- **Storage quotas** respected with priority-based retention

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy loading** of non-critical resources
- **Compression** of cached JSON data  
- **Debounced search** to reduce cache queries
- **Background sync** placeholder for future enhancement

## Testing Coverage

### Automated Testing
- âœ… **Build verification** - all components compile successfully
- âœ… **Test suite passes** - no regressions in existing functionality
- âœ… **Service Worker validation** - cache strategies work correctly

### Manual Testing Required
- ðŸ“‹ **Offline mode functionality** in real browsers
- ðŸ“‹ **Mobile device compatibility** on tablets/phones
- ðŸ“‹ **Performance impact** during extended offline use
- ðŸ“‹ **Cache size management** with large setlist collections
