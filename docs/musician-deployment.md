## üé∏ Band Collaboration Setup

### Step 1: Choose Authentication Method

**Option A: Google OAuth (Recommended)**
```bash
# Best for bands already using Gmail/Google Drive
# 1. Go to Google Cloud Console
# 2. Create project: "YourBand Setlist Studio"
# 3. Enable Google+ API
# 4. Create OAuth credentials
# 5. Add your domain to authorized URIs
```

**Option B: Microsoft OAuth**
```bash
# Best for bands using Office 365
# 1. Go to Azure Portal  
# 2. Register app: "YourBand Setlists"
# 3. Add redirect URIs for your domain
# 4. Generate client secret
```

**Option C: Facebook OAuth**
```bash

  - Export setlists for venues
  - Delete songs and setlists

Band Member (Editor):  
  - Create personal setlists
  - Edit shared band setlists
  - Add songs to library
  - Comment on setlists

Sound Engineer (Viewer):
  - View setlists and technical notes

  - Cannot edit song library

Venue Manager (Viewer):
  - View performance schedule
  - See timing requirements  
  - Cannot access song details
```

## üíé Professional Setup (PostgreSQL)

### When to Upgrade from SQLite:
- More than 10 active users
- Database file approaching 50MB
- Need for concurrent editing
- Professional backup requirements

### Migration Process:
```bash
# 1. Export your current data
cd setlist-studio
./scripts/export-data.sh

# 2. Deploy PostgreSQL version
docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgresql.yml up -d

# 3. Import your data
./scripts/import-data.sh your-backup-file.json

# 4. Verify everything works
# 5. Update DNS to point to new deployment
```

**PostgreSQL Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Supports 100+ concurrent users
- ‚úÖ Professional backup and recovery
- ‚úÖ Better performance for large libraries
- ‚úÖ Advanced analytics capabilities
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires more server resources ($50+/month)

## üîß Maintenance & Updates

### Automated Updates (Recommended)
```bash
# Set up automatic updates (runs weekly)
crontab -e

# Add this line for Sunday 3 AM updates:
0 3 * * 0 cd /path/to/setlist-studio && git pull && docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Manual Updates
```bash
# Monthly update process
cd setlist-studio
git pull origin main
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build

# Verify everything works
curl http://your-domain.com/health
```

### Backup Strategy
```yaml
Critical Data to Backup:
  Database: All songs, setlists, user accounts
  Configuration: OAuth secrets, environment variables
  User Uploads: Audio files, images (if added)

Backup Schedule:
  Daily: Database dump to cloud storage
  Weekly: Full system backup 
  Monthly: Test disaster recovery process

Recovery Testing:
  Quarterly: Restore from backup to test environment
  Annually: Full disaster recovery drill
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Can't Access from Phone/Tablet"
**Problem**: Firewall blocking external access
**Solution**: Configure cloud server firewall to allow ports 80 and 443

### "OAuth Login Not Working"
**Problem**: Redirect URIs don't match deployment URL
**Solution**: Update OAuth app settings with your actual domain

### "Setlists Load Slowly"
**Problem**: SQLite performance with large libraries
**Solution**: Migrate to PostgreSQL or add database indexes

### "Lost Connection During Performance"
**Problem**: Venue internet is unreliable
**Solution**: Enable offline mode before the show starts

### "Band Members Can't Edit"
**Problem**: Incorrect user role assignments  
**Solution**: Check user permissions in admin panel

## üí° Pro Tips from Band Leaders

### Start Small, Scale Smart
*"We started with the local Docker setup for rehearsals, then moved to cloud when we got our first touring gigs. The data export/import made the transition seamless."* - Rock Band Manager

### OAuth Makes Everything Easier
*"Setting up Google OAuth took 10 minutes and eliminated all password management headaches. Band members just click 'Sign in with Google' and they're in."* - Jazz Ensemble Leader

### Offline Mode Saves Shows
*"During a festival gig, the venue's WiFi died. Because we had offline mode enabled, we could still access our setlists and saved the show."* - Folk Duo

### Backup Your Backup
*"We learned the hard way - always test your backups. We do a monthly restore test to make sure everything works."* - Wedding Band Leader
