# Security Threshold Enforcement Strategy

## Philosophy
**Complete Assessment Before Decision**: Run all security tools to completion, then evaluate all findings together to make an informed pass/fail decision.

## Core Strategy

### **Centralized Enforcement Approach**
Instead of failing immediately when any security tool finds issues, we allow all tools to complete their scans and then evaluate all findings together in a single enforcement step.

**Why This Approach:**
- Provides complete security visibility
- Enables better prioritization of fixes
- Prevents incomplete assessments
- Offers comprehensive security reporting

## Security Thresholds

### ðŸ”´ **Zero Tolerance**
- **Exposed Secrets**: No API keys, passwords, or credentials in code
- **Vulnerable Dependencies**: No packages with known security vulnerabilities
- **Critical/High Severity**: CVSS >= 7.0 issues cause build failure

### ðŸŸ¡ **Monitoring Only**
- **Medium Severity**: CVSS 4.0-6.9 (logged but non-blocking)
- **Outdated Packages**: Tracked for maintenance planning

## Workflow Design

### **Phase 1: Comprehensive Scanning**
All security tools run independently with error tolerance:
- Secret detection across Git history
- Dependency vulnerability analysis
- Static code analysis for security issues
- Filesystem security scanning
- Comprehensive dependency checks

### **Phase 2: Threshold Enforcement**
Single centralized step that:
- Evaluates all scan results
- Applies consistent thresholds
- Provides detailed failure reporting
- Makes final pass/fail decision

## Benefits

### **For Development Teams**
- See complete security picture before addressing issues
- Prioritize fixes based on full context
- Understand security posture holistically

### **For Security Teams**
- Consistent enforcement across all projects
- Comprehensive audit trail
- Flexible threshold management
- Complete vulnerability visibility

## Decision Framework

**Pass Criteria**: All security thresholds met across all tools
**Fail Criteria**: Any zero-tolerance threshold exceeded
**Reporting**: Complete results regardless of pass/fail status
